# PHP Installation
> In order to Behat to work we need PHP installed. The required version of PHP is 7 and above. Preferably 7.3.

**The following PHP extensions are needed too**

- bz2
- curl
- mbstring
- bcmath
- json
- zip
- fileinfo

First step is to check if we have PHP installed and what version it is. To do that, we need to run this command in the terminal.

```
php -v
```
